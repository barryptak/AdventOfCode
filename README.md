My Python (3.10) solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

These are not intended to be the fastest, most succinct, or cleverest solutions around.

I'm creating them as a way to learn and practise Python and am mostly favouring readability and clarity over cleverness. Everything is intended to be well documented and laid out in order to aid my own understanding and that of anyone else interested.</br>

To run these solutions you need to install the main package first via
```pip install .``` in the root dir. This allows each of the solution modules to access the common utils packages.</br></br>
I suggest using ```pip install -e .``` if you plan on modifying the utils code so that you don't need to reinstall the package after every change.</br>
