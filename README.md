My Python (3.10) solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

These are not intended to be the fastest, most succinct, or cleverest solutions around.

I'm creating them as a way to learn and practise Python and am mostly favouring readability and clarity over cleverness. Everything is intended to be well documented and laid out in order to aid my own understanding and that of anyone else interested.</br>
